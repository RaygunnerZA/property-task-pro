# CHAPTER 7 — AI INTELLIGENCE ARCHITECTURE

**7.1 — PURPOSE**
AI is an advisor, extractor, and critic. It never overrides user decisions.

**7.2 — THE STACK**
Input → Interpretation (Vision/OCR) → Structuring → Critic → Intelligence (Flags) → Interaction.

**7.3 — CAPABILITIES**
*   **Image:** Asset recognition, condition detection.
*   **Audio:** Transcription, summarisation, action extraction.
*   **Flags:** Scarcity, Weather, Compliance Risk.

**7.6.1 — AI & NAVIGATION**
The Adaptive Context Navigation provides a structured intent surface for AI.
AI uses `entity_type` and `active context` to prioritise actions in the Action Layer. AI never invents navigation items.
