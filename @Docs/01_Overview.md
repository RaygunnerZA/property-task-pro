# CHAPTER 1 — Overview, Vision & Core Architecture

**1. FILLA — PURPOSE, VISION & POSITIONING**

Filla is a tactile, intelligent property-care system built around three universal pillars:

**1. A unified model for home, work, staff, and contractors**
One system for Homeowners, Property Managers, Staff, and Contractors. Every identity loads a **different mode**, but shares the **same backend architecture**.

**2. A scheduling & compliance engine that treats maintenance as obligations, not reminders**
Tasks are obligations, recurring rules, and compliance cycles. This creates a “property health timeline”.

**3. A deeply integrated AI layer**
AI enhances capture, naming, tagging, compliance extraction, and risk detection. AI never overrides; AI proposes → user confirms.

**2. FILLA SYSTEM PILLARS**
1. Identity & Organisation System
2. Onboarding System
3. Data Model & Supabase Schema
4. RLS, Permissions & Security
5. UI/UX System (Tactile Neomorphism)
6. Task Engine
7. Scheduling + Automations Engine
8. Compliance Intelligence Engine
9. AI Architecture
10. Asset Management System
11. Messaging System
12. Analytics & Dashboards
13. Multilingual Copy System
14. Developer Infrastructure

**3. GLOBAL DESIGN ETHOS**
Filla is **calm**, **tactile**, **paper-based**, **neomorphic**, and **human**. The interface is soft, touchable, and carved (not bordered).

**4. SYSTEM-WIDE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
1. **Everything is org_scoped.**
2. **Identity determines mode.**
3. **Evidence = truth.**
4. **Schedules generate instances.**
5. **AI suggests, humans decide.**
6. **Attachments & annotations are first-class.**
7. **All surfaces are textured paper.**
8. **Every action creates events.**
9. **Data contexts load in strict hierarchy.**
